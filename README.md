#  E-Commerce Vendor Performance Analysis  

##  Project Overview  
Effective vendor and inventory management are critical for profitability in the retail and wholesale industry.  
This project analyzes vendor performance, sales trends, and inventory efficiency using **Python (EDA)** and an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.  

The analysis aims to identify **top-performing vendors and brands**, assess **bulk purchase cost savings**, reduce **capital locked in unsold inventory**, and uncover opportunities for **pricing and promotional adjustments** to maximize sales and profits.

##  Business Objectives  
The main objectives of this project are to:  
- Identify underperforming brands needing **promotional or pricing adjustments**  
- Determine **top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit**  
- Analyze the **impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs**  
- Assess **inventory turnover** and capital tied up in unsold stock  
- Investigate **profitability variance** between high- and low-performing vendors

##  Power BI Dashboard  
The Power BI dashboard provides:  
- Vendor & Brand performance overview  
- Bulk purchase impact visualization  
- Inventory vs Sales ratio monitoring  
- Profitability and sales trends  

---

##  Key Insights  
- **Top 10 vendors contribute 66% of procurement**, indicating dependency risk  
- **Bulk purchasing reduces unit cost**, confirming cost-saving opportunities  
- Vendors like **Diageo North America Inc** show high capital lock in unsold stock  
- Some brands with **low sales but high profit margins** need pricing adjustments  

---

##  Final Recommendations  
- Strengthen relationships with top vendors for better pricing leverage  
- Optimize inventory turnover to **reduce excess stock** and free capital  
- Promote **underperforming brands with high margins** to boost sales  
- Diversify vendor base to reduce **procurement dependency risks**
