# 📊 E-Commerce Vendor Performance Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Effective vendor and inventory management are critical for profitability in the retail and wholesale industry.  
This project analyzes vendor performance, sales trends, and inventory efficiency using **Python (EDA)**, **SQLite3 database**, and an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.  

Additionally, **AI tools** were leveraged for **research, insight validation, and report preparation**, ensuring a business-oriented, data-driven approach.

## 🎯 Business Objectives  
- Identify underperforming brands needing **promotional or pricing adjustments**  
- Determine **top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit**  
- Analyze the **impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs**  
- Assess **inventory turnover** and capital tied up in unsold stock  
- Investigate **profitability variance** between high- and low-performing vendors

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for EDA  
- **SQLite3** – For structured data querying and management  
- **Power BI** – For interactive dashboard creation  
- **AI Tools (ChatGPT & others)** – For research, insight validation, and report writing  
- **GitHub** – For version control and project documentation
